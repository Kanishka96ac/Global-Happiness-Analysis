# 🌍 Global Happiness Report Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the **World Happiness Report** dataset to uncover patterns, insights, and global trends in happiness across countries. Using Python and advanced data visualisation tools, it highlights how variables such as GDP, social support, health, and corruption perception influence happiness scores globally.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
- **Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Data Analysis**: pandas, numpy
- **Visualisation**: seaborn, matplotlib, plotly, cufflinks
- **Data Cleaning**: regex, lambda functions
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab-ready)

## 📊 Dataset Summary
- **Source**: World Happiness Report (available via Kaggle or UN sources)
- **Columns**: Country, Region, Happiness Score, GDP per Capita, Health (Life Expectancy), Freedom, Trust (Gov. Corruption), Generosity
- **Rows**: ~155 countries

## 🔍 Key Features & Analysis Steps
- Cleaned and structured country-level data
- Performed null analysis and handled missing values
- Created derived features (e.g., ranking, score deltas)
- Generated correlation heatmaps and pairplots
- Visualised:
  - Top 10 happiest countries
  - GDP vs Happiness Score
  - Regional happiness trends
  - Social support and corruption impact
- Built interactive visuals using `plotly` and `cufflinks`
- Aggregated and compared data across multiple regions

## 📈 Sample Insights
- Countries with high GDP, health, and social support consistently rank highest
- Scandinavian countries dominate the top happiness scores
- Freedom and low corruption perceptions strongly correlate with overall happiness
- Some high-GDP countries rank lower due to trust and freedom indicators

## 🚀 How to Run
